# Student_Integration_API
This project is a Student Management System developed using ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend and Angular (Standalone Components) for the frontend. It implements JWT-based authentication, allowing users to register and log in securely. Authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on student records. The backend uses EF Core with SQL Server.
